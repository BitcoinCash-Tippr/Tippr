Tippr revolutionizes Bitcoin tipping by allowing people to tip anyone, even if they don't already have a Bitcoin wallet or social account.

This is version v0.0.1. Some thanks is in order:

-Thanks to Wade Dempsey for buying the tippr.org domain.
<br />
-Thanks to /u/cryptodude1 on Reddit for the original idea.
<br />
-Thanks to Twitter Bootstrap for being awesome. (Enough said.)
<br />
-Thanks to the countless others who have helped us work out the kinks!

If you know PHP, please help contribute code! The files for the Chrome extension are also in here, so if you know any special Chrome tips that we don't- help out!
